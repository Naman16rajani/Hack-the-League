# LegalLens

During the hackathon, the LegalLens team worked tirelessly, utilizing their expertise in the MERN stack and front-end technologies to develop a cutting-edge solution. We started by building a robust back-end using MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for handling server-side logic, and Node.js for server-side runtime. This back-end architecture ensured secure and efficient data storage and retrieval.
